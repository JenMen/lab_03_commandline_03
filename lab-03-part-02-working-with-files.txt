----------

(same Question as 13)
ent-v321-009:mtec1003-lab-03 student$ rmdir my_files
rmdir: my_files: Directory not empty
ent-v321-009:mtec1003-lab-03 student$ 

==========
15. MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE mtec1003-lab-03 directory!

$ rm -rf my_files
----------

ent-v321-009:mtec1003-lab-03 student$ ls

ent-v321-009:mtec1003-lab-03 student$ 

==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------

I used cat books/other/pg1232.txt and it displayed the book that was in that file.

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

Title: The Prince

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below.
----------

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------

I used less and more after books/other/pg1232.txt, [space] moves down the page and [q] exited.

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------

-Less is used more for showing all the content of a certain file
-more is to show a lesser part of the file or directory
-cat Is exactly like less but doesn't give you the option to scroll up and down the txt.
-tail shows the end of the txt or file.
-head only shows the top of the txt or file.

==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?

ent-v321-009:mtec1003-lab-03 student$ wc books/other/pg1232.txt
    5063   52639  305864 books/other/pg1232.txt

==========
22.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
